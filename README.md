# yolov8-streamlit-app

* Currently webcame feature isnt working after deploying to streamlit app but it works locally, you can test it out locally if you want.
* Uses base yolov8 model pre-trained on coco dataset
* Added a custom fine-tuned yolov8 model for potholes detection
* To use your custom trained model, just add your .pt files into the weights and make some minor changes to the settings.py and app.py files
